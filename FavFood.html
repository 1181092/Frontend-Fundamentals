    <h1>Vegetable Lasagna</h1>
    <p>
        It might seem an odd choice but I acctually enjoy a good vegetables's
        lasagna more than a traditional meat one. This one is delicious and still
        feels preety much the same as my mom's with that thick tomato sauce and
        all of the cheese strings.

        <h4><em>Remaining ingredients </em></h4>
        <li>2 cups low-fat cottage cheese, <em>divided</em></li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt, <em>to taste</em></li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper, <em>to taste</em></li>
        <li>9 no-boil lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>2 cups freshly grated low-moisture, part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
        <br>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 220 degrees Celcius. ⏰</li>
        <br>
        <li>
            To prepare the veggies: In a large skillet over medium heat, warm the
            olive oil. Once shimmering, add the carrots, bell pepper, zucchini,
            yellow onion, and salt. Cook, stirring every couple of minutes, until
            the veggies are golden on the edges, about 8 to 12 minutes. ⌛
        </li>

            alt="Chopped vegetables in a skillet.">
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>
            Add a few large handfuls of spinach. Cook, stirring frequently, until
            the spinach has wilted. Repeat with remaining spinach and cook until all
            of the spinach has wilted, about 3 minutes. Remove the skillet from the
            heat and set aside.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, to prepare the tomato sauce: Pour the tomatoes into a mesh
            sieve or fine colander and drain off the excess juice for a minute.
            Then, transfer the drained tomatoes to the bowl of a food processor. Add
            the basil, olive oil, garlic, salt, and red pepper flakes. 🍅
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Pulse the mixture about 10 times, until the tomatoes have broken down to
            an easily spreadable consistency. Pour the mixture into a bowl for later
            (you should have a little over 2 cups sauce). Rinse out the food
            processor and return it to the machine.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Pour half of the cottage cheese (1 cup) into the processor and blend it
            until smooth, about 1 minute. Transfer the mixture to large mixing bowl.
            No need to rinse out the bowl of the food processor this time; just put
            it back onto the machine because you’ll need it later.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Transfer the cooked veggies and spinach mixture to the bowl of the food
            processor. Pulse until they are more finely chopped (but not puréed!),
            about 5 to 7 times, stopping to scrape down the sides as necessary.
            Transfer the mixture to the bowl of whipped cottage cheese. Top with the
            remaining cottage cheese, then add ¼ to ½ teaspoon salt (to taste) and
            lots of freshly ground black pepper. Stir to combine. Now it’s lasagna
            assembly time! 👩🏼‍🍳

        <br>
        <br>
        <li>
            Spread ½ cup tomato sauce evenly over the bottom of a 9” by 9” baking
            dish. Layer 3 lasagna noodles on top (snap off their ends to fit, and/or
            overlap their edges as necessary). Spread half of the cottage cheese
            mixture evenly over the noodles. Top with ¾ cup tomato sauce, then
            sprinkle ½ cup shredded cheese on top. 🧀
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
            Top with 3 more noodles, followed by the remaining cottage cheese
            mixture (we’re skipping the tomato sauce in this layer.) Sprinkle ½ cup
            shredded cheese on top.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Top with 3 more noodles, then spread ¾ cup tomato sauce over the top
            (you may have a little sauce leftover) to evenly cover the noodles.
            Sprinkle evenly with 1 cup shredded cheese.
        </li>

        <br>
        <br>
        <li>
            Wrap a sheet of parchment paper or foil around the top of the lasagna
            (don’t let it come into contact with the cheese). Bake, covered, for 18
            minutes, then remove the cover, rotate the pan by 180° and continue
            cooking for about 10 to 12 more minutes, until the top is turning spotty
            brown. 🥧
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
            Remove from oven and let the lasagna cool for 15 to 20 minutes, so it
            has time to set and cool down to a reasonable temperature. Sprinkle
            additional basil over the top, then slice and serve.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Now your lasagna is ready to be enjoyed by all your friends and family, even the ceptic ones! </p>
