        <p><i>An Abundance of Katherines</i> is a young adult novel by John Green. Released in 2006, it was a
            finalist
            for the Michael L. Printz Award. The novel includes an appendix by Daniel Biss, a close friend of Green,
            that explains some of the more complex equations used by the main character, Colin Singleton.</p>

                    <h3>
                        Plot Summary
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Colin Singleton, a child prodigy living in Chicago, fears he will not maintain his genius as an
                        adult. Over the span of his life, Colin has dated nineteen girls named Katherine, all spelled in
                        that manner. After being dumped by his girlfriend, Katherine XIX, Colin is longing to feel
                        whole, and longing to matter. He hopes to become a genius by having a <i>eureka</i> moment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After graduating from high school, and before college, Colin's best and only friend, Hassan
                        Harbish, convinces him to go on a road trip to take his mind off the breakup. Colin goes, hoping
                        to find his <i>eureka</i> moment. After reaching a rural Tennessee town called Gutshot, they
                        visit the supposed resting place of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. There, they meet Lindsey Lee Wells
                        and her mother Hollis, whose family runs a local textile mill. Hollis allows Colin and Hassan to
                        stay with her family and offers them a summer job interviewing the town's residents and
                        assembling an oral history of Gutshot.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Colin begins to like Lindsey, though he is foiled by her boyfriend, Colin Lyford (he and Hassan
                        call him TOC, <i>the other Colin</i>), whose father is employed by Lindsey's mother, Hollis.
                        Colin is still chasing his eureka moment, finally finding it in the theorem he created called
                        the <b><i>Theorem of Underlying Katherine Predictability</i></b>. It determines the curve of any
                        relationship based on several factors of the personalities of the two people in a relationship.
                        His theorem eventually works for all but one of his past relationships with a Katherine—which
                        the novel explores.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While the back stories of Colin's life play out, Hassan finds a girlfriend, Katrina, a friend of
                        Lindsey's. Their relationship is cut short when Colin and Hassan catch Katrina having sex with
                        Lyford while on a feral hog hunt with Lindsey, her friends and Lyford's father. A fight between
                        Lyford and all the surrounding acquaintances begins when Lindsey finds out that he has been
                        cheating on her. Injured in the fight, Colin anagrams the Archduke's name while in the graveyard
                        to dull the pain, and realizes that it is actually Lindsey's great-grandfather, named Fred N.
                        Dinzanfar, who is buried in the tomb.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Colin finds Lindsey at her secret hideout in a cave, where he tells her the story of every
                        Katherine he has ever loved. Lindsey tells him how she does not feel sad but instead slightly
                        relieved by Lyford's affair. They discuss what it means to them to <b><i>matter</i></b> and
                        eventually confess their love for each other. As their relationship continues, Colin decides to
                        use his theorem to determine whether he and Lindsey will last. The graph reveals that they will
                        only last for four more days. Lindsey slips a note under his door, four days later, stating that
                        she cannot be his girlfriend because she is in love with Hassan. But she leaves a P.S. stating
                        that she is joking. Colin realizes that his theorem cannot predict the future of a relationship;
                        it can only shed light on why a relationship failed. Despite this, Colin is content with not
                        <b><i>mattering</i></b>. Hassan says that he is applying for two college classes, which Colin
                        has been trying to convince him to do throughout the book. The story ends with the trio driving
                        past the restaurant they were originally planning to go to, because Colin, Lindsey, and Hassan
                        realize that they can just keep driving; there is nothing stopping them from continuing on.

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Colin Singleton: </b>
                            <p>Colin Singleton is an anagram-loving seventeen-year-old boy who is depressed. Though he
                                was a child-prodigy with an IQ of over 200, he has not yet become a
                                <b><i>genius</i></b>. Colin finds everything interesting, especially things that other
                                people seem not to care much about. Because of this, it is difficult for people to
                                relate to him. After only dating Katherines, Colin breaks the streak by dating Lindsey
                                Lee Wells, whom he met on his road trip with Hassan. Throughout the novel Colin feels as
                                though there is a hole in his stomach, and he is looking to fill it. Colin spends his
                                time striving to be unique, but with Lindsey's help, ends up coming to the realization
                                that he is "not-unique in the very best way possible."
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Hassan Harbish: </b>
                            <p>
                                Hassan Harbish is Colin Singleton's lazy, funny, and slightly overweight best (and only)
                                friend. Though he is smart and has been accepted to college, Hassan takes a year off. At
                                first he does not seem to plan on furthering his education. He convinces Colin to go on
                                a road trip to break out of his depression. Hassan is Muslim and prays regularly, acting
                                with strict religiosity, until he dates Katrina. Hassan is an integral part of Colin's
                                journey to find his true identity.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Lindsey Lee Wells:</b>
                            <p>Lindsey Lee Wells meets Colin Singleton and Hassan Harbish on their road trip in Gutshot,
                                Tennessee. She is a paramedic-in-training who also gives tours of Gutshot. When Lindsey
                                first appears in the novel, she is dating Lyford. However, she does not feel that she is
                                truly herself until she starts hanging around Colin. Like him, Lindsey seems to be
                                struggling with her identity. Inspired by Colin's ability to always be himself, Lindsey
                                finally becomes herself. She also becomes Colin's girlfriend after her break-up with
                                Lyford.

                            <p>She is Lindsey's mother and an extreme workaholic who is very kind to the people who work
                                at her factory.

                    <h3>Style and Format</h3>
                    <p>The novel is written in a third-person narrative. Green used third person to create empathy for
                        Colin. In a blog post, Green wrote that the novel <q>needed to be written in third person,
                            because
                            it's about a guy whose brain does not lend itself to narratives, and who struggles to tell
                            stories in ways other people find interesting.</q>
                    </p>
                    <p>The story includes many footnotes that become an essential part to understanding Colin's brain
                        and how it works. Green says that the footnotes <q>function as a kind of competing narrative
                            that
                            comments upon and —for lack of a better word— problematizes the central narrative.</q> An
                        Abundance of Katherines is a work of fiction that includes many mathematical terms and academic
                        language. With the footnotes and the appendix that is at the end of the novel, Green gives his
                        readers <q>a way of attempting to achieve precision and clarity</q> of the story in general, but
                        more
                        specifically, Colin's mind.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The book consists of 19 chapters to highlight the number 19. These chapters include Colin's
                        flashbacks, which are <q>meant to reflect the relationship we have between chronological
                            narrative
                            and emotional narrative.</q> This format is also known as a non-linear narrative.

                    <h3>Symbols</h3>
                    <h4>Archduke Franz Ferdinand</h4>
                    <p>
                        Franz Ferdinand is an anagram of Lindsey's great grandpa's name, Fred N. Dinzanfar. Ferdinand
                        becomes a symbol of what is most important to Colin: mattering. Though Ferdinand is famous, he
                        did not really do much; he is famous for being shot. "While some people are remembered, others
                        are forgotten, and a lot of times it doesn't matter whether we try to do something noteworthy or
                        not. History gets to decide, ultimately, whether we're remembered."
                    </p>
                    <h4>Lindsey's Cave</h4>
                    <p>
                        Lindsey's cave is her "super, incredibly top secret location that no one on Earth knows
                        about."[3] Colin is the only person she shows the cave to. This symbolizes the comfort and trust
                        in their relationship. It also stands for Lindsey's privacy. Green has acknowledged that the
                        cave can also be seen as a representation for Lindsey's vagina. He says that Colin's romantic
                        journey with Lindsey "is a journey away from the (phallic) obelisk and toward the (sapphic)
                        cave, and in the end only in the place associated with femininity is Colin able to become
                        authentically himself with someone else."
